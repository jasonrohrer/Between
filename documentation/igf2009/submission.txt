Instructions:

Installation:  just run the self-extracting archive.

The game explains its controls to you as you play it.  Keyboard only, no mouse input.  Only keys used by the game:  Up, Down, Left, Right, B, N, W, S, Space.

No need to memorize these, though, since keyboard hints appear in the game.

After the title screen, the game should connect to the server.  Your best bet at this stage (given that the game is not public yet) is to arrange a play time with a friend.  Generate a new game and give the 7-digit code to your friend.  After your friend enters the code, the game will start.

This game is for TWO PLAYERS ONLY.
